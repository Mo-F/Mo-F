## Research

I am mainly interested in rigorous modeling and verification of real-world systems. I focus on automatizing the modeling and verification of specifications deployed on real systems, as to render formal methods accessible to non-expert practitioners.

During my PhD, I had worked within the [RIS](https://www.laas.fr/public/en/ris) team at [LAAS-CNRS](https://www.laas.fr/public/en) on semantisizing the robotic framework [GenoM3](https://git.openrobots.org/projects/genom3/wiki/Wiki), based on which I developed several mathematically proven translations to major formal verification frameworks, namely [Fiacre](http://projects.laas.fr/fiacre/)/[TINA](http://projects.laas.fr/tina/), [UPPAAL](https://uppaal.org), [UPPAAL-SMC](http://people.cs.aau.dk/~adavid/smc/), and [Real-Time BIP (RT-BIP)](https://www-verimag.imag.fr/BIP-Tools-93.html?lang=en). This work involved several partners from different universities, laboratories and companies: the [VERTICS team](https://www.laas.fr/public/en/vertics) (LAAS-CNRS), the [Verimag Lab](https://www.verimag.fr), the [FMAES team](http://www.es.mdh.se/research-groups/35-Formal_Modelling_and_Analysis_of_Embedded_Systems) ([University of Mälardalen](https://www.mdh.se/en/malardalen-university)) and [EasyMile Toulouse](https://easymile.com), and resulted in templates that automatically translate any GenoM3 specification into the aforementioned formal environments. The case studies ranged from a drone flight control to a terrestrial navigation, on which various real-time properties were verified using different techniques (model checking, statistical model checking and runtime verification). See my [PhD thesis](https://www.dropbox.com/s/25wv00vx28394yd/paper.pdf?dl=0), [Publications](https://mo-f.github.io/Mo-F/Publications) and [Artefacts](https://mo-f.github.io/Mo-F/Artefacts) for more details.

A summary of my postdoctoral research activities is given below.

- I participated in the [DSAAM](https://redmine.laas.fr/projects/dsaam) decentralized simulation framework for cyber-physical systems, developed within the RIS team at LAAS-CNRS. My contribution to the framework consisted in proposing rigorous formal syntax and semantics and the development of liveness proofs. See the QRS paper under [Publications](https://mo-f.github.io/Mo-F/Publications) for more details. 

- I pioneered a binary-search-based method that allows extending timed automata models of robotic applications with dynamic-priority schedulers in a (more) scalable way. See my two papers on the subject (DETECT & JSA in [Publications](https://mo-f.github.io/Mo-F/Publications)) and the [Artefacts](https://mo-f.github.io/Mo-F/Artefacts) section for more details.

- I was the lead contributor to a research activity on formal execution and runtime verification of robotic applications using the [BIP real-time engine](https://www-verimag.imag.fr/Real-Time-Engine.html). In particular, this work relies on a fully automatic translation of robotic specifications into RT-BIP, executing the resulting RT-BIP models on a real robotic platform, and verifying timed properties at runtime using RT-BIP monitors. See the MEMOCODE paper under [Publications](https://mo-f.github.io/Mo-F/Publications) and the videos links under [Artefacts](https://mo-f.github.io/Mo-F/Artefacts)  for more details.

- I am the main investigator of [Verimag](https://www.verimag.fr)/[Université Grenoble Alpes](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/english/) in the European [ADE project](https://www.h2020-ade.eu). Using the [BIP Toolset](https://www-verimag.imag.fr/BIP-Tools-93), I developed, validated and integrated the Fault Detection, Isolation and Recovery (FDIR) components to embark on [the planetary rover](https://www.h2020-ade.eu/news/videos/) used in ADE. See the i-Sairas paper under [Publications](https://mo-f.github.io/Mo-F/Publications)  for more details.

- I proposed a hybrid approach combining schedulability analysis and statistical model checking techniques to rigorously verify autonomous aerial robots. See the RTCSA paper under [Publications](https://mo-f.github.io/Mo-F/Publications) for more details.

- I played a major role in a research effort pertaining to contract-based verification of model transformations in Model-Driven Engineering approaches. In particular, I proposed a formal, yet engineer friendly environment for a lightweight verification of some "correctness" properties of transformations from [AADL](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/our-work/projects/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_4050=191439).  See the SAC paper under [Publications](https://mo-f.github.io/Mo-F/Publications) for more details.
