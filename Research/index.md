## Research

### Today

I am mainly interested in rigorous modeling and verification of real-world, real-time systems. A major part of my research is based on timed automata and timed logics. 

Currently, my research activities gravitate around three major axes (see the [Publications](https://mo-f.github.io/Mo-F/Publications) section for the full text of the referenced articles):

- Hybrid approaches for the scalable verification of multicore real-time systems. See JSA 2023 and COMPSAC 2024.

- Runtime monitoring of real-time systems. See MEMOCODE 2020, FORMATS 2024 (best paper award) and ECOOP 2025 (distinguished paper award). 

- Safe AI-enabled CPS. See HSCC 2025 (best reproducibility award). 

Recently, I took some interest in computing education research. See Koli Calling 2023.

Celle d'aujourd'hui est (de loin) meilleure.
