## Artefacts

Below is a selection of some useful links (videos and artefacts) related to my [research activities](https://mo-f.github.io/Mo-F/Research/). Detailed README files are provided in all repositories. For more artefacts, please refer to the text of my [publications](https://mo-f.github.io/Mo-F/Publications/).



[This link](https://gitlab.math.univ-paris-diderot.fr/foughali/fhz_aeic-jsa) directs to the artefact related to the JSA 2023 paper (see [Publications](https://mo-f.github.io/Mo-F/Publications/)). It includes an open-source, automatic chain to solve the affinity problem, as well as to verify various real-time properties of multicore real-time systems. These include a tight computation of tasks WCRTs while integrating blocking due to sharing data. A tutorial video to use the chain is available as well.


[This link](https://github.com/Mo-F/uppaal-smc-exp) directs to the artefact related to the SPIN paper (see [Publications](https://mo-f.github.io/Mo-F/Publications/)). It includes automatic generation of an UPPAAL-SMC model from a drone robotic application as well as statistical model checking of various behavioral and timed properties.

 

The MEMOCODE paper's (see [Publications](https://mo-f.github.io/Mo-F/Publications/)) experiments videos are available [here](https://bit.ly/3i8IXs4). There are three videos that show the whole experiment, from automatic generation of RT-BIP models out of robotic specifications, to the execution of the generated RT-BIP models and runtime verification of a timed property on both the real and simulated robotic platforms.

 

The binary-search-based technique, presented in the DETECT and JSA papers (see [Publications](https://mo-f.github.io/Mo-F/Publications/)) is backed up with a detailed artefact [here](https://github.com/Mo-F/sched-artefact). Files are clonable and allow comparing the proposed technique with the classical "counting" one.
